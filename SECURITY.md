## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Security Contact
For security issues, please email: security@protein-operators.org

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### What to Include
Please include:
* Description of the vulnerability
* Steps to reproduce the issue
* Potential impact assessment
* Suggested fixes (if available)

### Response Timeline
* **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
* **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
* **Status Updates**: Every 2 weeks
* **Resolution**: Varies by severity

## Security Considerations

### Computational Security

#### Model Integrity
* **Checksum Verification**: All model weights include cryptographic checksums
* **Signed Models**: Production models are cryptographically signed
* **Version Control**: Complete audit trail for model changes

#### Input Validation
```python
# Example: Secure constraint validation
def validate_constraints(constraints: Constraints) -> bool:
    """Validate constraints to prevent injection attacks."""
    
    # Size limits
    if len(constraints.binding_sites) > MAX_BINDING_SITES:
        raise SecurityError("Too many binding sites specified")
    
    # Value ranges
    for site in constraints.binding_sites:
        if not (1 <= site.residue_id <= MAX_RESIDUE_ID):
            raise SecurityError("Invalid residue ID")
    
    # String sanitization
    ligand_name = sanitize_string(constraints.ligand_name)
    
    return True
```

#### Resource Limits
* **Memory Bounds**: Prevent memory exhaustion attacks
* **Computation Limits**: Timeout protection for long-running operations
* **Rate Limiting**: API request throttling

### Biological Security

#### Dual-Use Research of Concern (DURC)
This software can design proteins with various functions. We implement safeguards:

* **Toxin Detection**: Automated screening against known toxic sequences
* **Pathogen Similarity**: Alerts for designs similar to pathogenic proteins
* **Expert Review**: Human oversight for potentially concerning designs

#### Screening Pipeline
```python
class BiosafetyScreener:
    """Screen designed proteins for potential safety concerns."""
    
    def screen_design(self, structure: ProteinStructure) -> ScreeningResult:
        result = ScreeningResult()
        
        # Check against toxic protein database
        result.toxicity_score = self.check_toxicity(structure)
        
        # Analyze pathogen similarity
        result.pathogen_similarity = self.check_pathogen_db(structure)
        
        # Functional annotation screening
        result.concerning_functions = self.check_functions(structure)
        
        # Overall risk assessment
        result.risk_level = self.assess_risk(result)
        
        if result.risk_level >= RiskLevel.HIGH:
            self.trigger_expert_review(structure, result)
        
        return result
```

### Infrastructure Security

#### Container Security
* **Minimal Base Images**: Use distroless or minimal base images
* **Regular Updates**: Automated security patch management
* **Non-Root Execution**: Containers run as non-privileged users
* **Secret Management**: Secure handling of API keys and credentials

#### API Security
* **Authentication**: Strong API authentication mechanisms
* **Authorization**: Role-based access control
* **Input Sanitization**: Comprehensive input validation
* **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse

#### Data Security
* **Encryption**: Data encrypted in transit and at rest
* **Access Controls**: Principle of least privilege
* **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for data access
* **Data Retention**: Clear data retention policies

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Coordinated Disclosure
We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Notification**: Initial report kept confidential
2. **Investigation**: Thorough security analysis
3. **Fix Development**: Patch development and testing
4. **Coordinated Release**: Public disclosure with fix
