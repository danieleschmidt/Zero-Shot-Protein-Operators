* **Knowledge Sharing**: Helping others learn neural operators and protein design
* **Respectful Disagreement**: Engaging in scientific debates with respect and professionalism

### Unacceptable Behavior
Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination
* Trolling, insulting comments, or personal attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without consent
* Academic misconduct or plagiarism

* Report concerns about misuse to project maintainers
* Follow institutional biosafety guidelines

### Data and Model Sharing
* Respect intellectual property rights
* Follow data sharing agreements
* Ensure proper attribution for datasets and models
* Maintain confidentiality of unpublished research

## Enforcement

### Reporting
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [conduct@protein-operators.org](mailto:conduct@protein-operators.org).

### Investigation Process
1. **Initial Review**: Reports reviewed within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: Thorough investigation of reported incidents
3. **Decision**: Appropriate corrective action determined
4. **Communication**: Clear communication with all parties

* GitHub repositories and issues
* Community forums and chat platforms
* Social media interactions related to the project
* Conference presentations and academic venues
* Email communications

## Scientific Integrity

### Research Standards
* All contributions must meet high standards of scientific rigor
* Experimental validations must be reproducible
* Statistical analyses must be appropriate and properly reported
* Conflicts of interest must be disclosed

### Attribution
* Proper citation of prior work and influences
* Clear acknowledgment of collaborators and contributors
* Respect for intellectual property rights
* Transparent reporting of funding sources

## Attribution
