# SDLC Analysis for Zero-Shot Protein-Operators

## Classification
- **Type**: Research/Experimental Project → Machine Learning Library/Tool (transitioning)
- **Deployment**: Open Source Package + Docker + Cloud Service
- **Maturity**: Prototype/PoC (early phase development)

4. **Clear Roadmap**: Well-planned phases from prototype to production
5. **Interdisciplinary**: Requires ML + computational biology + physics expertise

## Recommendations

### Phase 1 (Current - Foundation): Research Project Focus
Since this is a research prototype in early development, implement **Research/Academic Project** SDLC patterns:

#### Essential Infrastructure
1. **Development Environment Setup**
   - `environment.yml` for reproducible conda environment
   - `pyproject.toml` for Python packaging and dependencies
   - Docker containers for development and deployment
   - GPU-enabled development setup

2. **Research Code Organization**
   - `src/protein_operators/` package structure
   - `experiments/` for research scripts and notebooks
   - `data/` for datasets and training data
   - `models/` for neural operator implementations
   - `scripts/` for data processing and training

3. **Research-Focused Validation**
   - Physics-based unit tests for energy conservation
   - Benchmark datasets for validation
   - Experimental design tracking
   - Reproducibility requirements

4. **Documentation for Researchers**
   - Detailed installation instructions for GPU environments
   - Theory documentation linking to papers
   - API documentation for neural operators
   - Tutorial notebooks for different use cases

#### Avoid Over-Engineering
- Skip enterprise features (complex CI/CD, monitoring, etc.)
- No premature API versioning or backward compatibility
- Simple deployment (containers + basic cloud setup)
- Focus on scientific validation over production robustness

### Phase 2 Transition: Research → Production Tool
When implementation matures (Phase 2), transition to **Machine Learning Library** patterns:

1. **Package Distribution** (PyPI, conda-forge)
2. **API Stability** (semantic versioning, deprecation policies)
3. **Performance Optimization** (GPU acceleration, memory efficiency)
4. **User Experience** (web interface, visualization tools)

### Phase 3+: Platform/Service
For later phases, consider **Service/API** patterns for cloud deployment and enterprise features.
